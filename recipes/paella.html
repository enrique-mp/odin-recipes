      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This seafood paella with calamari is the dish all your family and
        friends will beg you to make again. It is incredibly flavorful and has
        been made by my family in Catalonia, Spain for many generations.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ¼ pounds chicken thighs</li>
        <li>½ cup onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ pound calamari rings</li>
        <li>¼ pound small shrimp - peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>½ green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>½ red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>3 cups long grain rice</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup peas</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons saffron threads</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 large clams in shell, scrubbed</li>
        <li>6 jumbo shrimp in shells (21-25 per lb.)</li>
        <li>6 large sea scallops</li>
        <li>6 wedges lemon</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
        Heat olive oil in a very large skillet or paella pan over medium-high
        heat until it begins to smoke. Sear chicken thighs, skin-side down, in
        hot oil until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove
        chicken thighs to a plate and set aside.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Stir onion and garlic into drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir until
        onion is softened and translucent, about 1 minute. Add calamari, small
        shrimp, and bell peppers; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
        Stir in water, rice, tomatoes, peas, saffron, and salt until well
        combined. Return chicken thighs to the skillet; simmer over medium-high
        heat for 15 minutes, stirring frequently to make sure rice does not
        stick.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
        Decoratively nestle clams and jumbo shrimp into rice-chicken mixture.
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Place
        scallops into paella. Continue simmering, covered, until rice is tender
        and scallops are firm and opaque, about 5 minutes. Garnish with lemon
        wedges to serve.
